# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
    This application was created with the purpose of helping your typical 9am-5pm worker to organize their work day and be more efficient. The times were place in blocks of code that allow the app to change the color in order to help the worker see which tasks are overdue, are on time, and should be complete soon. It's also worth mentioning that this schedule works with an automatic day changer as well as time. Another great feature, it's the button placed at the end of the working hours, to help the user clear up the whole day for the following work day, instead of having to delete tasks one by one.
